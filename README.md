### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Seir, and Seir is a Javascript geek.

## My projects âš¡
* [FormsAuthentication](https://github.com/seirdotexe/FormsAuthentication)
  * By random I came across 'ASPXAUTH'. It's a library to encrypt and decrypt ASPX cookies used for forms authentication.
* [SAML2IO](https://github.com/seirdotexe/SAML2IO)
  * I needed a simple yet efficient SAML2 encoder and decoder for a small project, so I wrote one.
* [Angry Birbs Deobfuscator](https://github.com/seirdotexe/Angry-Birbs-Deobfuscator)
  * I noticed a community needed help due to a broken deobfuscator, and that's where I created one with additional tools.
