## Coding work üíª
* [FormsAuthentication](https://github.com/seirdotexe/FormsAuthentication) **[Archived]**
  * By random I came across 'ASPXAUTH'. It's a library to encrypt and decrypt ASPX cookies used for forms authentication.
* [SAML2IO](https://github.com/seirdotexe/SAML2IO)
  * I needed a simple yet efficient SAML2 encoder and decoder for a small project, so I wrote one.
* [ArtixProxy](https://github.com/seirdotexe/ArtixProxy)
  * I found out DragonFable is still a thing and created a simple proxy for it that's compatible for other Artix games.
* [Angry Birbs Deobfuscator](https://github.com/seirdotexe/Angry-Birbs-Deobfuscator) **[Archived]**
  * I noticed a community needed help due to a broken deobfuscator, and that's where I created one with additional tools.
* [GamedacJS](https://github.com/seirdotexe/GamedacJS)
  * Fixes for the Steelseries Gamedac written in Node.js.

Of course, I also have a few private projects in my library üòâ
