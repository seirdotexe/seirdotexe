## Future work üîÆ
* [Tauri](https://tauri.app/) with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) and [Preact](https://preactjs.com/)
  * I'd like to make a simple lightweight app using Tauri
* [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)
  * I'd like to move to the future and implement MongoDB into my projects

## Coding work üíª
* [SAML2IO](https://github.com/seirdotexe/SAML2IO)
  * I needed a simple yet efficient SAML2 encoder and decoder for a small project, so I wrote one.
* [ChaCha20](https://github.com/seirdotexe/chacha20)
  * Every Javascript implementation of ChaCha20 I came across was either poorly written or outdated. I decided to bundle it up together into modern Javascript.
* [GamedacJS](https://github.com/seirdotexe/GamedacJS)
  * Fixes for the Steelseries Gamedac written in Node.js.
* [Angry Birbs Deobfuscator](https://github.com/seirdotexe/Angry-Birbs-Deobfuscator) **[Archived]**
  * I noticed a community needed help due to a broken deobfuscator, and that's where I created one with additional tools.
* [FormsAuthentication](https://github.com/seirdotexe/FormsAuthentication) **[Archived]**
  * By random I came across 'ASPXAUTH'. It's a library to encrypt and decrypt ASPX cookies used for forms authentication.

Of course, I also have a few private projects in my library üòâ

## Markdown work üìù
* [Steelseries Gamedac fixes](https://github.com/seirdotexe/Steelseries-Gamedac-fixes)
